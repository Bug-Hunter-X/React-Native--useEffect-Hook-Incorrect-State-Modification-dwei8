This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback that attempts to modify state or props outside of a state update function.  This often happens when you're fetching data and trying to update state directly within the callback.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Incorrect: Directly modifying state
      this.setState({ data: data }); 
    });
}, []);
```
